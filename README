This distribution contains code for the S-Lang <TEMPLATE> module.  See the
documentation in the doc/ directory for information about using the
module once it has been installed.

<TEMPLATE> itself is a command-line tool that for transfering files using a
multitude of protocols (FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, GOPHER, TELNET, ...).
The S-Lang module interfaces with the <TEMPLATE> library allowing access to
such protocols from the S-Lang interpreter.

To build the module, you will need the following additional libraries
installed:

   1.  Version 2 of slang library <http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/>.
       The module will not work with version 1.

   2.  A recent version of the <TEMPLATE> library.  This library is part of
       the <TEMPLATE> distribution, and may be obtained from
       <http://<TEMPLATE>.haxx.se/>.  Debian users can install the
       <TEMPLATE> library using

          apt-get install lib<TEMPLATE>3-dev

You must run the configure script before you can compile the module.
If the slang library is installed in a non-standard location, then you
will need to specify the location of the library as arguments to the
configure script.  For example, suppose libslang.so is located in
/home/bill/lib and its include file slang.h is located in
/home/bill/include. Then one would run the configure script using:

  ./configure --with-slanglib=/home/bill/lib \
              --with-slanginc=/home/bill/include

or, the shorter form which assumes a common pathname prefix for the
lib and include directories:

  ./configure --with-slang=/home/bill

Similarly, if lib<TEMPLATE>.so is not installed in a standard location, then
you will need to use the --with-<TEMPLATE>inc and --with-<TEMPLATE>lib, or
--with-<TEMPLATE> options.  For example, if if lib<TEMPLATE>.so is in
/opt/soft/lib and <TEMPLATE>/<TEMPLATE>.h is in /opt/soft/include, then use

   --with-<TEMPLATE>=/opt/soft

as an argument to the configure script.  (Note: <TEMPLATE>.h will be
installed in a <TEMPLATE> subdirectory, i.e., /opt/soft/include/<TEMPLATE>/<TEMPLATE>.h).

You should also specify a location for the modules (*.so) and any associated
script (*.sl) files created by this package.  The default location for
the modules is in

   $prefix/lib/slang/modules/

Any .sl files will be installed in

   $exec_prefix/share/slsh/local-packages/

where the values of the variable $prefix defaults to /usr/local, and
that of $exec_prefix to the value of $prefix.  These values may be
changed using the --prefix and --exec-prefix configure script
parameters.  For example, to set the value of $prefix to /home/bill,
use

   ./configure --prefix=/home/bill ...

For more help using the configure script, run it using

   ./configure --help

It is also a good idea to read the INSTALL.txt file located in this
directory.

Once the configure script has been run, you should inspect
the Makefile that it generated in the src directory.  Then building
and installing the library should involve nothing more than:

   make
   make install

You may have to have root privileges to peform the last step.
